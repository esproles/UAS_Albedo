# Bridging the Scaling Gaps in Earth Observations with UAS 

## Project overview
The seasonal accumulation and melt of snow is a critical cycle that sustains life in the mountain-west.
The albedo, or reflectance of snow is a metric used in hydrology models to quantify water
storage in the snowpack and predict timing of runoff. Daily and bi-weekly satellite albedo products are
offered by MODIS and Landsat respectively, and weather stations provide a sparse network of in-situ
measurements for calibration of these satellite data. This project develops and deploys a UAS-based
method of measuring the earthâ€™s albedo to bridge the gap in scale between ground station
measurements and satellites, quantify lateral variation in albedo due to terrain and snowpack
characteristics, and to observe variation in albedo at different altitudes of measurement.

## Goals
- Develop and test a UAS-based system for measuring albedo
- Quantify variation in albedo laterally and at different scales
- Compare UAS albedo measurements to Landsat 7 albedo values at the field
site

## Development
The system is composed of two Kipp and Zonen pyranometers, one facing up and one facing
down, mounted on a DJI Matrice 210 quadcopter to detect incoming and reflected broadband
shortwave infrared radiation. Mounts for the sensors and a data logger were designed in
Autodesk Fusion360 and printed with a fused deposition modeling 3D printer. Test flights using
3D printed dummy sensors were preformed to test the integrity of the mounts and weight
distribution on the UAS.

## Deployment, Results and Impact
The study area for this project is a mountain meadow at 2600 meters, located just outside of the
Yellowstone Club Ski Area in Big Sky, Montana. One flight was preformed on a cloudy, snowy
day in April 2019, and another on a bright sunny day during a Landsat 7 pass-over in May 2019.
On both flights, the UAS was able to capture variation in albedo across the landscape. Albedo
varied significantly between snow-covered areas and tree-covered areas, and to a minor extent
within snow-covered areas. The UAS data from the second flight, coincident with Landsat 7,
showed considerable heterogeneity that the satellite did not pick up.

Our results demonstrate the capability of a UAS to measure albedo in a snowy, mountainous
environment and offer a means of improving satellite calibrations in remote locations where
ground-based measurements are sparse.

This project was featured in a news article in the Montana State University College of Letters
and Science newsletter and results were presented at the 2019 ESIP summer meeting in Tacoma,
WA. We are also preparing a manuscript for publication.

## Timeline
